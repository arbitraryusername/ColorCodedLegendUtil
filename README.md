# ColorCodedLegendUtil

Weather maps are usually color coded, making them not very accessible to people with color blindness. This app helps with that by drawing an arrow from the point the user clicked to the region on the legend corresponding to the clicked pixel's color.

This project comes with 4 weather maps pulled from Climavision's website. The local database is seeded when the app starts up for the first time, so you have 4 maps to test out this program with. There are more updates on the way!

About the code: cross-platform Blazor Server project targeting .NET 8
